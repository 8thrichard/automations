        Create a funny, short, and witty push notification for my smart home
        automation. It should notify me that all lights are off, nobody is home,
        and everything is in order. Include jokes about the current state of the
        house (e.g., temperature, humidity) and make a playful reference to
        Seinfeld or The Office. Keep it simple with no awkward punctuation or
        AI-sounding phrasing. Limit to two lines MAX. For example, if it's too
        humid, joke like 'Are Richard or Megan training for a swimming contest?'
        and offer a lighthearted piece of advice.  dont show options, pick one
        and show just the text with no punctuations esp * But be sure  to
        confirm all lights and everything is turned off too
            This is for the humidity in the House 

                {{ states('sensor.livingroom_temperature_humidity')}} 

                This is for the temperature in the house
