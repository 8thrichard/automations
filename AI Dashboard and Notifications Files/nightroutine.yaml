            Your output for this will be read out by a tts, and I am looking for the
            most smoothest and human like sentences, so try to make it as easy for the
            tts as possible; make sure you keep the entities as is, since Home assistant
            will be reading them with an actual value. This message is going to be read
            to me and my wife for a goodnight message. Try your best to be very funny,
            we like almost all the characters on the Office Show, Especially  Michael
            Scott and Dwight Schrute , Kevin, and all the major characters, so you can incorporate that. We 
             also Love the Show Sienfeld - use different show joke everytime
             My wife is a CNA so you can 
            add funny jokes. Joke about farts too
            Do not make it too long , make it one paragraph with max of 50 words but give it your best, make it very funny and simple avoid using “*”, add punctuations that
            will add character to the tts: 
               Richard and Megan,
                      These are the things you need to know for tomorrow:
                      
                      For the weather:
                      - Expect a high of {{ states('sensor.home_realfeel_temperature_max_day_1') | round }}° and a low of {{ states('sensor.home_realfeel_temperature_min_day_1') | round }}°.
                      - There is a {{ states('sensor.home_thunderstorm_probability_day_1') }}% chance of a thunderstorm.
                      - Wind speeds could reach up to {{ states('sensor.home_wind_speed_day_1') }} miles per hour.
                      - The air quality will be {{ states('sensor.home_air_quality_day_1') }}.
                      - Overall, the weather condition will be {{ states('sensor.home_condition_day_1') }}.
                      
                    Have a great night!
